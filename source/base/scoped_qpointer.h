// Owning smart pointer for QObject-derived types. Behaves like std::unique_ptr, but on reset()
// schedules deletion via deleteLater() instead of calling delete directly. This makes it safe to
// release objects that may still be processing queued events or live in another thread.
//
// The held pointer is stored as QPointer<T>, so if the object is destroyed externally (for
// example by its Qt parent), the pointer auto-nulls and reset() becomes a no-op instead of
// dereferencing a dangling pointer.
//
// NOTE: reset() does not disconnect signals. If the held object is still emitting signals
// between the deleteLater() call and its actual destruction, those signals will reach connected
// receivers as usual. Call disconnect() manually before reset() if this matters (typical reasons:
// the object lives in another thread and is actively emitting, or there are external subscribers
// that must stop receiving signals immediately).
//
// T may be forward-declared at the point of member declaration; the underlying QPointer<T>
// requires T to derive from QObject, but the check is deferred until the type is actually used.
